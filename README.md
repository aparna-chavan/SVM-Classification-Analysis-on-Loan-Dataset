# SVM-Classification-Analysis-on-Loan-Dataset

**Overview:**
This project delves into the in-depth exploration of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification techniques. The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of SVM and its application on the provided Loan dataset. The analysis involves utilizing three different types of kernels to classify and compare their performances.

**SVM Classification:**

**Objective:**
Understand the intricacies of SVM classification and apply it to predict outcomes in the Loan dataset. Explore the impact of three distinct kernel types on the classification performance.

**Implementation:**

1. Utilize Python for SVM implementation, leveraging appropriate libraries.
2. Apply three different kernel types (linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) for classification.
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of each kernel through metrics and visualizations.
